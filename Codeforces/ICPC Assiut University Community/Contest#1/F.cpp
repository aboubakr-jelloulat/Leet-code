	âœ… The bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that operates on the binary representations of two numbers. 
	It compares the corresponding bits of the two numbers and produces a result based on the following rule:

	âœ… For each bit position:

		ðŸš€ If exactly one of the bits is 1, the result is 1.

		ðŸš€ If both bits are 0 or both bits are 1, the result is 0.

	ðŸ†˜ exampleeeeeeeee :

		0 ^ 0 = 0
		0 ^ 1 = 1
		1 ^ 0 = 1
		1 ^ 1 = 0
